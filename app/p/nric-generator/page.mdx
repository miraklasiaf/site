The **National Registration Identity Card (NRIC)** is a unique identification number and document issued to Singapore citizens and permanent residents. It serves as an official form of identification and is essential for various aspects of daily life in Singapore.

The NRIC structure follows the format: `@xxxxxxx#`

- **@ (Prefix)**: A letter that indicates the status of the holder:

  - **S**: Singapore citizens and permanent residents born before 1 January 2000.
  - **T**: Singapore citizens and permanent residents born on or after 1 January 2000.
  - **F**: Foreigners issued with long-term passes before 1 January 2000.
  - **G**: Foreigners issued with long-term passes on or after 1 January 2000.
  - **M**: Foreigners issued with long-term passes from 1 January 2022 onward.

- **xxxxxxx (Seven Digits)**:  
  A unique sequence assigned to the individual, often based on their registration or birth order.

- **# (Checksum)**:  
  A single letter derived from a checksum calculation using the seven digits and predefined rules. This serves as a validation mechanism to ensure the NRIC number is valid.
