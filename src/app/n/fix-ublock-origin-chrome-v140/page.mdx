# How to Get uBlock Origin Working on Chrome v140

<AnimatedName />

Google Chrome v140 has introduced stricter rules for extensions, particularly around Manifest V2. This has broken compatibility with some popular extensions, including **uBlock Origin**, which still relies on Manifest V2 for certain functionality.

Fortunately, there's a workaround that allows you to keep using uBlock Origin on Chrome v140. In this guide, I'll walk you through the step-by-step process.

---

## Step 1: Download the Stable Chromium Release of uBlock Origin

1. Head over to the official [uBlock Origin GitHub releases page](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).
2. Download the latest stable `chromium.zip` package.

3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder.
   - Make sure you know where the root folder is, as we'll need it later.

## Step 2: Enable Required Chrome Flags

1. Open a new tab and go to:
   ```
   chrome://flags
   ```
2. In the search bar, look for these flags and enable them:
   - **Temporarily unexpire M139 flags.**
   - **Allow legacy extension manifest versions.**
3. After enabling each one, click **Relaunch** to restart Chrome.

## Step 3: Load uBlock Origin as an Unpacked Extension

1. Open a new tab and go to:
   ```
   chrome://extensions
   ```
2. Toggle on **Developer mode** (top-right corner).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the folder where you extracted the `chromium.zip` earlier.

5. Toggle the switch to **enable** uBlock Origin.

<Image alt="step 4" src={step4.src} width={1200} height={800} />

You should now see the familiar **uBlock Origin shield icon** in your Chrome toolbar.

---

## Step 4: Confirm It's Working

- Visit a website with ads or trackers and ensure that uBlock Origin is blocking content as expected.
- Click on the extension icon to verify the filter lists are loaded.

---

## Final Thoughts

This method is a **temporary workaround**. Chrome will eventually remove the “legacy manifest” flags, at which point uBlock Origin will need to be fully adapted to Manifest V3 (or users may need to switch to Chromium-based browsers that still support V2).

For now, though, these steps let you keep using one of the most powerful ad and tracker blockers available.
